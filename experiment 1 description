*Introduction to the Laboratory and Cisco Packet Tracer*

In this laboratory session, we will explore the basics of networking using Cisco Packet Tracer, a versatile network simulation tool developed by Cisco. Cisco Packet Tracer allows users to create network topologies, configure devices, and simulate various network scenarios in a virtual environment. It is widely used for educational purposes to help students and professionals understand networking concepts, practice configuration skills, and prepare for certification exams like CCNA. By using this tool, you can visualize the network's behavior and troubleshoot issues without the need for physical hardware, making it an essential resource for anyone learning or working in the field of networking.
